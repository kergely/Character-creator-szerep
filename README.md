# Character-creator-szerep
Basic character creator, originally intented for Mythras

Requirements:
- matplotlib package for python

We are using JSON files to connect between various parts of the program.
Written in python 2.7.10, hopefully works on three, untested there.
UI to be added later.

All is created by using the freely available Runequest Essentials and the Mythras Imperative.
